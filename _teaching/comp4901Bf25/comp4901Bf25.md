# Large Language Models

**COMP 4901B, Fall 2025**  
**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**  
[**Junxian He**](https://jxhe.github.io)

**Course description**: this is an undergraduate-level course to cover the basics and latest advances about large language models. This course will start with the basics of language models, and then cover the latest advances in large language models. It will include core techniques on developing LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, Qwen, LLama, etc. Applications and potential risks of LLMs will also be covered. Throughout this course, you are expected to (1) know the basic principles of language models and how it works; (2) be able to use LLMs and know how to tame it in practice; (3) understand the core development techniques and are able to train language models in relatively simple scenarios.

### Contact and Communication
[Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/64649) is the main platform for communication about technical questions of lecture contents and homeworks. Please do not directly email the teaching staff on technical questions which may easily get lost. The teaching staff will try to answer questions on Canvas in a prompt manner. Some rules:

* All announcements and communications will happen over Canvas
* Please utilize the [Canvas Discussion](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/64649/discussion_topics) page to ask questions. There are pre-existed discussion topics initiated by the staff such as lecture questions and each homework. Please post your questions in the respective thread, you are also encouraged to answer others' questions if you know the answer.
* While we allow students to optionally post anonymous questions and answers on Canvas, please do not post anything inappropriate as anonymous users -- in such cases, we will turn off the anonymous option.  
* If you have non-technical, private matters, please email the teaching staff directly.
* Please consult the [Course Logistics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mWm_TYYQpD3NpJISlFQGurBIXxWjizEc1zVffIDhiXU/edit?usp=sharing) page before asking logistical questions.
* For longer discussions, please come to office hours.

### Prerequisites and Materials
Students are required to have taken machine learning courses and know basics about machine learning and deep learning.

This course does not have a textbook as large language models is a fast-evolving field, but I will recommend blogs or papers to read for the respective lecture.
