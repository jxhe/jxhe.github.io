# Machine Learning

**COMP 5212, Spring 2026**  
**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**  
[**Junxian He**](https://jxhe.github.io)

**Course description**: this is an advanced machine learning course to provide a broad introduction to machine learning, covering foundational machine learning concepts, theory, algorithms, and applications. The topics include supervised learning (logistic regression, linear models, classification, SVM, kernal methods, naive Bayes), unsupervised learning (clustering, expectation maximization, graphical models, HMM), and reinforcement learning. It will include some optimization/learning topics (gradient descent, SGD, MLE and MAP estimation) as well. Certain aspects of deep learning are introduced（neural network basics, architectures, VAEs, GANs). The last lectures will give a general introduction to techniques in large language models.

[Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/67842) is the main platform for communication about technical questions of lecture contents and homeworks.

### Prerequisites and Materials
Students are required to be familiar with probability and linear algebra, and able to program well in Python. The [CMU 10701 self-assessment exam](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10701_Spring23/Intro_ML_Self_Evaluation_new.pdf) is a good resource to roughly give you a notion of the background that is required for this course.

This course does not have a textbook, but here are some helpful materials:
